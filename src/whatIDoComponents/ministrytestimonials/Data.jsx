      "Shola’s public ministerial work began in 2006 when he started a prayer chain with some friends via BBM (BlackBerry Messenger) and email. Later that year, she started holding weekly prayer meetings with ladies. These prayer meetings metamorphosed into a ministry, called Household of Faith Fellowship – for young people and lovers of Christ. The first monthly meeting held on the 10th of June 2007 and this meeting held until it was renamed Hope365 in 2015 – a ministry which currently has several expressions; one of which is called ‘When Friends Pray’.",
